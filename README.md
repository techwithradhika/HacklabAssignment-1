# Traffic Light Simulator

This is a simple web application that simulates a traffic light using Finite State Machines (FSM). 
The application controls the traffic light with three buttons: Red, Green, and Yellow. 
The state transitions of the traffic light are governed by the following rules:

- Initial State: Red
- Transition from Green to Yellow after 15 seconds (6 minutes)
- Transition from Yellow to Red after 5 seconds
- Transition from Red to Green after 20 seconds
